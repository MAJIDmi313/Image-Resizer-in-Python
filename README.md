# Image-Resizer-in-Python
This is a Python program that uses the Pillow library to resize images. The program allows you to specify the filename of the image and the new dimensions (width and height) that you want to resize the image to. It then uses the Pillow library to open the image file, resize it to the new dimensions, and save the resized image with a new filename.
